# RouteNet-Fermi

This is the official implementation of RouteNet-Fermi, a pioneering GNN architecture designed to model computer 
networks. RouteNet-Fermi supports complex traffic models, multi-queue scheduling policies, routing policies and 
can provide accurate estimates in networks not seen in the training phase.

## Quick Start
### Project structure

The project is divided into three main blocks: scheduling, traffic models, and scalability. Each block has its own 
directory and contains its own files. In each directory we can find four main files:
- `main.py`: contains the code for the training/validation of the model.
- `ckpt_dir`: contains the trained models for the specific experiment.
- `predict.py`: contains the code for the predictions. It automatically loads the best-trained model and 
saves its predictions in a `predictions.npy` file that can be read using NumPy.

The project also contains some auxiliary files like `datanetAPI.py` used to read the different datasets and the 
`data_generator.py` that is used to convert the samples provided by the dataset API into the graph that is taken as
input by the model, and a `generate_dataframe.py` which saves the data in a Pandas Dataframe used to compute the scores.

You can find more information about the reproducibility of the experiments inside each one of the directories 
([Traffic Models](/TrafficModels/README.md), [Scheduling](/scheduling/README.md),  [Scalability](/scalability/README.md),
[All Mixed](/all_mixed/README.md), [Testbed](/testbed/README.md), [Real Traffic](/real_traffic/README.md), [FatTree](/fat_tree/README.md)).
